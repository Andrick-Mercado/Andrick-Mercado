Learning Outcomes:
In this project, I learned how to develop low-level language techniques, 
or more specifically create grammar rules based on EBNF grammar rules, 
it was really interesting to apply these rules into code, 
I managed to get all the points with my current solution at least the ones that were displayed.
I also learn how to add more rules to them not just the ones given,
 as I would just need to implement a new list and rules which shouldnâ€™t be that hard.
