spam detector using naive baiyes classifier
----------------------------
Main file is ExtractContent.py
- run it and input the directory for training data first 
and secondly the directory of the testing data
- make sure to input as follows ./TR and ./TT
- the program is poorly optimized hence slow running
time will display name and as well as if its a spam or
not based on its words content
*** Explanation for how it works can be found in the pdf
called A2_ANdrick_Mercado, comments are provided hoefully
they provide good info***
